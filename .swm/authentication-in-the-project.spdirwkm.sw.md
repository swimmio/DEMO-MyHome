# AuthenticationService Interface

The AuthenticationService interface is the contract for any class that wants to provide authentication services. It declares a single method, `login`, which takes a LoginRequest object and returns an AuthenticationData object.

```java
public interface AuthenticationService {
  AuthenticationData login(LoginRequest loginRequest);
}
```

# Implementation of AuthenticationService

The AuthenticationService interface is implemented by the AuthenticationSDJpaService class. This class provides the actual logic for the `login` method declared in the interface.

```java
public class AuthenticationSDJpaService implements AuthenticationService {
```

# Usage of the login method

The `login` method of the AuthenticationService interface is used in the AuthenticationController class. This class uses the method to authenticate users when they attempt to log in.

```java
  private final AuthenticationService authenticationService;
```
