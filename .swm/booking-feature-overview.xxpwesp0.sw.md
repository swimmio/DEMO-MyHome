# The Role of the BookingService Interface

The `BookingService` interface is a contract for any class that wants to provide booking services. It currently has a single method `deleteBooking` which takes an amenityId and a bookingId as parameters and returns a boolean indicating the success of the operation.

```java
public interface BookingService {

  boolean deleteBooking(String amenityId, String bookingId);

}
```

The `deleteBooking` method is used to delete a booking. It is defined in the `BookingService` interface and implemented in any class that provides booking services.

```java
  boolean deleteBooking(String amenityId, String bookingId);
```

# Implementation of BookingService

`BookingService` is implemented in `BookingSDJpaService` class and used in `BookingController` class. This shows that the booking services are provided by `BookingSDJpaService` and used by `BookingController` to handle HTTP requests related to bookings.
