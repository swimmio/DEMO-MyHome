# Usage example

`CommunityService` is implemented by the `CommunitySDJpaService` class in the `com.myhome.services.springdatajpa` package. This class provides concrete implementations for all the methods declared in the `CommunityService` interface.

<SwmSnippet path="/service/src/main/java/com/myhome/services/springdatajpa/CommunitySDJpaService.java" line="54">

---

# Usage example

Here is an example of how the `createCommunity` method is implemented in the `CommunitySDJpaService` class. It generates a unique ID for the community, retrieves the user ID from the security context, adds the admin to the community, saves the community to the repository, and returns the saved community.

```java
  public Community createCommunity(CommunityDto communityDto) {
    communityDto.setCommunityId(generateUniqueId());
    String userId = (String) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal();
    Community community = addAdminToCommunity(communityMapper.communityDtoToCommunity(communityDto),
        userId);
    Community savedCommunity = communityRepository.save(community);
    log.trace("saved community with id[{}] to repository", savedCommunity.getId());
    return savedCommunity;
```
