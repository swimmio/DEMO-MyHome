# Usage example

`DevMailSDJpaService` is an example of how `MailService` is used. It implements `MailService` and overrides its methods. Each method logs a message and returns true, simulating the sending of an email.

```java
public class DevMailSDJpaService implements MailService {

  @Override
  public boolean sendPasswordRecoverCode(User user, String randomCode) throws MailSendException {
    log.info(String.format("Password recover code sent to user with id= %s, code=%s", user.getUserId()), randomCode);
    return true;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean sendAccountConfirmed(User user) {
    log.info(String.format("Account confirmed message sent to user with id=%s", user.getUserId()));
    return true;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean sendPasswordSuccessfullyChanged(User user) {
    log.info(String.format("Password successfully changed message sent to user with id=%s", user.getUserId()));
    return true;
  }


```
