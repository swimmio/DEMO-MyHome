title: Optimizing the Implementation of the AuthenticationService
---
This document will cover the existing implementation of the AuthenticationService in the DEMO-MyHome project and discuss potential areas for improvement. The topics we will cover include:

1. Overview of the AuthenticationService
2. Examination of the login method
3. Potential areas for improvement

# Overview of the AuthenticationService

The AuthenticationService interface defines a single method, `login`, which takes a `LoginRequest` object and returns an `AuthenticationData` object.

```java
public interface AuthenticationService {
  AuthenticationData login(LoginRequest loginRequest);
}
```

# Examination of the login method

The `login` method in the `AuthenticationSDJpaService` class implements the `login` method defined in the `AuthenticationService` interface. It first retrieves the user based on the email provided in the `LoginRequest`, checks if the provided password matches the stored password, creates a JWT token, and finally returns an `AuthenticationData` object containing the encoded token and user ID.

```java
  @Override
  public AuthenticationData login(LoginRequest loginRequest) {
    log.trace("Received login request");
    final UserDto userDto = userSDJpaService.findUserByEmail(loginRequest.getEmail())
        .orElseThrow(() -> new UserNotFoundException(loginRequest.getEmail()));
    if (!isPasswordMatching(loginRequest.getPassword(), userDto.getEncryptedPassword())) {
      throw new CredentialsIncorrectException(userDto.getUserId());
    }
    final AppJwt jwtToken = createJwt(userDto);
    final String encodedToken = appJwtEncoderDecoder.encode(jwtToken, tokenSecret);
    return new AuthenticationData(encodedToken, userDto.getUserId());
  }
```

# Potential areas for improvement

While the current implementation of the AuthenticationService is functional, there are a few areas that could potentially be improved. For instance, the `login` method could be made more robust by adding additional error handling and logging. Additionally, the process of creating the JWT token could potentially be extracted into a separate method or service to improve code modularity and reusability.
