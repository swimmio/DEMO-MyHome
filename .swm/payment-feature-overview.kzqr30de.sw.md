# The Role of the PaymentService Interface

The `PaymentService` interface is the service layer for the Payment feature. It provides several methods to handle different aspects of payments, such as scheduling a payment, retrieving payment details, and getting payments by member or admin.

```java
public interface PaymentService {
  PaymentDto schedulePayment(PaymentDto request);

  Optional<PaymentDto> getPaymentDetails(String paymentId);

  Set<Payment> getPaymentsByMember(String memberId);

  Page<Payment> getPaymentsByAdmin(String adminId, Pageable pageable);

  Optional<HouseMember> getHouseMember(String memberId);
}
```

# Methods of the PaymentService Interface

The `PaymentService` interface provides four key methods: `schedulePayment`, `getPaymentDetails`, `getPaymentsByMember`, and `getPaymentsByAdmin`. These methods are used throughout the codebase to handle different aspects of payments. For example, `schedulePayment` is used to schedule a new payment, `getPaymentDetails` is used to retrieve the details of a specific payment, `getPaymentsByMember` is used to get all payments made by a specific member, and `getPaymentsByAdmin` is used to get all payments overseen by a specific admin.

```java
  PaymentDto schedulePayment(PaymentDto request);

  Optional<PaymentDto> getPaymentDetails(String paymentId);

  Set<Payment> getPaymentsByMember(String memberId);

  Page<Payment> getPaymentsByAdmin(String adminId, Pageable pageable);

  Optional<HouseMember> getHouseMember(String memberId);
```
