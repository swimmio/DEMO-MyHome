# The role of SecurityTokenService

The `SecurityTokenService` interface provides methods for creating and using security tokens. These tokens are used for confirming email addresses and resetting passwords, which are critical security features in the application.

```java
public interface SecurityTokenService {

  SecurityToken createEmailConfirmToken(User owner);

  SecurityToken createPasswordResetToken(User owner);

  SecurityToken useToken(SecurityToken token);
}
```
