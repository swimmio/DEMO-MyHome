# The Purpose of the SecurityTokenService Interface

The `SecurityTokenService` interface is designed to manage security tokens in the application. It provides methods to create and use security tokens.

```java
public interface SecurityTokenService {

  SecurityToken createEmailConfirmToken(User owner);

  SecurityToken createPasswordResetToken(User owner);

  SecurityToken useToken(SecurityToken token);
}
```

# Methods Provided by the SecurityTokenService Interface

The `SecurityTokenService` interface provides three methods: `createEmailConfirmToken`, `createPasswordResetToken`, and `useToken`. These methods are used to create email confirmation tokens, password reset tokens, and to use a given security token respectively.

```java
  SecurityToken createEmailConfirmToken(User owner);

  SecurityToken createPasswordResetToken(User owner);

  SecurityToken useToken(SecurityToken token);
```

# Usage of the SecurityTokenService Interface in the Codebase

`SecurityTokenService` is used in `UserSDJpaService` to manage security tokens related to user operations.

```java
  private final SecurityTokenService securityTokenService;
```

`SecurityTokenService` is also implemented in `SecurityTokenSDJpaService` to provide the actual functionality of the security token operations.

```java
public class SecurityTokenSDJpaService implements SecurityTokenService {
```
