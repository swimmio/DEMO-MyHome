# The HouseService Interface

The HouseService interface defines the operations related to a House. It includes methods for listing all houses, adding members to a house, deleting a member from a house, and retrieving house details and members by ID.

```java
public interface HouseService {
  Set<CommunityHouse> listAllHouses();

  Set<CommunityHouse> listAllHouses(Pageable pageable);

  Set<HouseMember> addHouseMembers(String houseId, Set<HouseMember> houseMembers);

  boolean deleteMemberFromHouse(String houseId, String memberId);

  Optional<CommunityHouse> getHouseDetailsById(String houseId);

  Optional<List<HouseMember>> getHouseMembersById(String houseId, Pageable pageable);

  Optional<List<HouseMember>> listHouseMembersForHousesOfUserId(String userId, Pageable pageable);
}
```
