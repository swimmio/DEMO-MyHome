# The Role of User in the UserService Interface

The UserService interface defines the contract for operations related to User. It includes methods for creating a user, resending email confirmation, listing all users, getting user details, requesting and resetting password, and confirming email.

```java
public interface UserService {
  Optional<UserDto> createUser(UserDto request);

  boolean resendEmailConfirm(String userId);

  Set<User> listAll();

  Set<User> listAll(Pageable pageable);

  Optional<UserDto> getUserDetails(String userId);

  boolean requestResetPassword(ForgotPasswordRequest forgotPasswordRequest);

  boolean resetPassword(ForgotPasswordRequest passwordResetRequest);

  Boolean confirmEmail(String userId, String emailConfirmToken);
}
```

# Usage of User Methods in the Codebase

The `createUser` method from UserService is used in the UserController's signUp method to create a new user.

```java
    UserDto requestUserDto = userApiMapper.createUserRequestToUserDto(request);
    Optional<UserDto> createdUserDto = userService.createUser(requestUserDto);
    return createdUserDto
```
