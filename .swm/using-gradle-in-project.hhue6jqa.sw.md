# Gradle Configuration

The `settings.gradle` file is where the project modules are defined and included. It also specifies the root project name. The `pluginManagement` block is used to define the plugins and their versions that are used across the project.

```gradle
pluginManagement {
  plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version "${springBootVersion}"
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version "${springDependencyManagementVersion}"
    id 'net.researchgate.release' version "${researchgateReleaseVersion}"
    id "org.openapi.generator" version "${openApiVersion}"
  }
}

rootProject.name = 'myhome-service'
include 'integration-tests'
include 'service'
include 'api'

```

# Gradle Build Script

The `build.gradle` file is the main build script for the project. It applies the necessary plugins, defines the repositories for dependencies, sets the group and version for the project, and configures the Java plugin. It also sets up configurations for development and runtime classpaths.

```gradle
plugins {
  id 'io.spring.dependency-management'
  id 'java'
}

allprojects {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
}

subprojects {
  group = 'com.prathab'
  version = '2.0.0'
  sourceCompatibility = '8'

  apply plugin: 'java'
  apply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management'

  configurations {
    developmentOnly
```

# Gradle Wrapper

The `gradlew` file is the Gradle Wrapper script. It ensures that the correct version of Gradle is used for building the project, even if it is not installed on the machine. It sets up the Java command to start the JVM and executes the Gradle command.

# Gradle Wrapper Properties

The `gradle-wrapper.properties` file contains properties for the Gradle Wrapper. It specifies the distribution URL for downloading the correct version of Gradle if it's not already downloaded.

```ini
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.3-bin.zip
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
```
